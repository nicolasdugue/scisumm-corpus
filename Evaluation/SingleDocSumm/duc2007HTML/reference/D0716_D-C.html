    to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park
    which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory.

    mine while ERA insists that its environmental record has been proven by the 16-year operation of the Ranger mine,
    also located in the Kakadu Park.

    arrested after they overwhelmed police and stormed onto the site.
