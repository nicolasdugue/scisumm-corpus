    of the Jabiluka uranium mine.

    concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an environmentally sensitive area, and by
    opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area.

    millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs.
