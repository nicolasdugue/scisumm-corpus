there are a number of different constraint languages within feature structure frameworks ( erg , Alshawi et al . 1991 ; Carpenter 1992 ; Dorre and Eisle 1991 ; Emele and Zajac 1990 ; Gerdemann and King 1994 ; Krieger and Schafer 1994 ; de Paiva 1993 ; Smolka 1989 ) . 
Legerdemain and G6tz 's Troll system ( see [ G6Tz 1993 ] , [ GFRDEIVIANN AND KING 1994 ] and [ GERDEMANN ( FC ) ] ) employs an efficient refinement of RES to test the satisfiability of feature structures .

It would, of course, not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures.

well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure, in ALl.:, type infereneing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable--in fact, all feature structures are well typed.
