In such unification-based formalisms, feature ~trueture (FS) unification is the most fundamental and ..~ignifieant operation.
The efficiency of the SING unification method depends on the following factors: (1) The overall FS unification failure rate of the process: in extreme cases, if Go unification failure occurs, the method has no advantages except the overhead of feature unification order sorting.
Other versions based on more efficient graph unification methods such as Wroblewski 's and Kogure 's method [ 23 , 16 ] have also been developed . 
In such cases, application of the EFF strategy, that is, treating features tending to fall in unification first, reduces unnecessary computation when the unification finally fails.

Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t,ranstormation were proposed from the late 1970s I;hrough the 1980s l(]azder eL al 85, l(aplan and Bresnan 82, Kay 1~5, Pollm'd and Sag 871.
in the learning process, when FS unification is applied, feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction.
The LING unification procedure uses a revised CopyNode procedure which does not copy structures immediately.

The output node has been created only when neither input node is current; or otherwise the output node is an existing current node.

That is , unless some new scheme for reducing excessive copying is introduced such as scucture-sharing of an unchanged shared-forest ( [ Kogure , 1990 ] ) .

Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification
Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying.
The revised CopyNode procedure takes as its inputs the node to be copied node I and the arc arc I with node I as its value and node2 as its immediate ancestor node (i.e., the arc's initial node), and does the following (set Fig.
